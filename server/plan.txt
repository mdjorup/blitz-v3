Goal: create a football picking app using the following integrations: 
 - Frontend:
   - React 
   - Redux
     - Manages all non-ui state of app to prevent redundant api calls including user
   - Tailwind CSS 
     - easier to edit and read css
 - Backend:
   - Node 
   - Express
     - create api endpoints to interact with mongodb and firebase auth
   - MongoDB
     - stores database for the application
   - Firebase Authentication
     - manages authentication 

Long process: 
1) Design layout for ui
2) Create all pages and components to implement ui
3) Design api 
4) Create api skeleton (all functions created without implementation)
5) implement ui authentication pages
6) implement server authentication functions
7) connect to sportsdataio api and store with redux (all non ui state data goes in redux)
8) implement all ui without functionality (except for navigation)
9) implement api skeleton
