Goal: create a football picking app using the following integrations: 
 - Frontend:
   - React 
   - Redux
     - Manages all non-ui state of app to prevent redundant api calls including user
   - Tailwind CSS 
     - easier to edit and read css
 - Backend:
   - Node 
   - Express
     - create api endpoints to interact with mongodb and firebase auth
   - MongoDB
     - stores database for the application
   - Firebase Authentication
     - manages authentication 

authentication notes
- on sign in and register,
- send a response back with the user object that is authenticated
- Need to ensure that user only makes requests when authenticated
- We do this by creating a middleware, which checks to see if user making request is authenticated
- On sign out, this will make the user not able to make any more user-dependent requests
- 

Long process: 
1) Design layout for ui
2) Create all pages and components to implement ui
3) Design api 
4) Create api skeleton (all functions created without implementation)
5) implement ui authentication pages
6) implement server authentication functions
7) connect to sportsdataio api and store with redux (all non ui state data goes in redux)
8) implement all ui without functionality (except for navigation)
9) implement api skeleton
